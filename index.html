					  <p>The JAM started from a modest point.</p>

            <p>The idea for the venue grew from the simple fact that Veronica Arenas, a friend of Blake Briand’s, had a few months left on her lease in a building that was meant to be a coffee shop. What started as jam sessions a few nights a week grew into large-scale events with full production. These concerts, charity events and even one wedding hosted hundreds on certain nights.</p>

            <p>This side project created by Briand, Veronica Arenas and her brother Eduardo Arenas blossomed from a place to hangout into what was truly a second home for many UF students and Gainesville residents. On any given night patrons of The JAM could see explosively talented individuals in an intimate setting. But beyond that, patrons always knew that The JAM was a place of acceptance, self-expression and plenty of love.</p>

            <p>Although The JAM closed nearly a year ago, the loyal concertgoers who call themselves the JAM Fam still celebrate its memory every time they go to a concert in Gainesville. The spirit of family that developed among anyone who ever attended The JAM is something that will live on always.</p>

      <p> Through the buzz and cacophony of construction in Gainesville, one small coffee shop continues to outlast the ever-changing city. Maude’s Classic Café has been serving up coffee, food, board games and good music since 1995.</p>

      <p>About 10 years ago, a Starbucks opened directly across the street from Maude’s little downtown spot. While many expected the dust of corporation construction to swallow up Maude’s business, this wasn’t the case. Maude’s has continued to thrive as
        a local tradition. People keep coming back because they like the eclectic and feeling of acceptance they get when walking through the doors.</p>

      <p>With “Rocky Raccoon” by The Beatles playing in the background, employee Max Eisenberg explains his thoughts on Maude’s: “A lot of staff is involved in the music scene – there have been many different band members on our staff.”</p>

      <p>"We embody the do-it-yourself scene and punk scene in town and I think it’s really important to expose people to these scenes,” says Eisenberg. “Maude’s has always been a part of it.”</p>

      <p>Maude’s is also a popular studying spot. Week days and weekends alike, the business fills up with students in need of good coffee. For those in need of a break from staring at a laptop screen or just needing to unwind, Maude’s also has a wide collection
        of board games to play.</p>

      <p>After visiting a few times, you start to notice the same faces. Maude’s employees are social and have regulars whom they interact with and even spend their breaks chatting with. The employees dress how they want to and aren’t afraid to speak what’s
        on their mind, which adds to the feel of the restaurant.</p>

      <p>Maude’s Classic Café closes at 9 p.m. and turns into Maude’s Sidecar Bar as the area becomes busier. From live music to drag shows, there’s entertainment of some kind. Maude’s is famous for its weekly drag show, “Downtown Drag.” </p>

      <p>“I got hired during a struggle at the company that had to do with old ownership,” Eisenberg says, “and all of the other coffee shops that have opened up in the past couple of years. I think the people who got hired really turned it around again.”

      <div class="doughBody">
        <p>Customers at ooZoo Bar beckoned manager David Scott over from the Dough Religion Pizza side of the restaurant on Sunday night. The manager of both businesses ran over, clinked a cup with the customers and took a shot. </p>

        <p>During the pizza joint and bar’s last few days, patrons and employees are making the most of the remaining inventory, as the restaurants will not be buying any more. </p>

        <p>“We’re trying to make the most of what we have and trying to remain positive,” Scott, 31, said. </p>

        <p>Dough Religion Pizza and ooZoo Bar, located at 1404 W University Avenue, are set to close when they run out of food sometime this week, tentatively on Wednesday. The businesses need to vacate the property by the first week of March. Managers of Spoon @ U14, the investment firm that owns the building, are in the process of selling the building for an undisclosed amount to an unidentified buyer. </p>

        <p>“It’s too early to confirm this,” investment manager Meir Zuchman said. He declined to comment on the allegations that this was a financially-driven decision. </p>

        <img class="img-responsive" src="images/outsidedough.jpg" alt="exterior of Dough Religion">

        <p>Scott and other managers said they speculate that the owners were offered a lot of money that they could not refuse. </p>

        <p>When asked if the construction of The Standard — a 10-story apartment building owned by Landmark Properties next door— was to blame for the business decision, no one could confirm it. </p>

        <p>Looking out the window toward the construction, Scott said, “Damn, with this place going in, a shift would have been coming.” </p>

        <p>About 40 employees — 60 percent of whom are estimated to be University of Florida students — will lose their jobs. </p>

        <p>“It’s pretty devastating,” Scott said. “The trajectory was very much positive, and considering all things, it is very disappointing that this is happening.” </p>

        <p>Scott said the creation of the connected restaurants was a group effort—the employees’ fingerprints are on the menu items and the designs, and “they feel like this place is partly theirs.” </p>

        <p>“We’ve really felt like we were on the precipice of a great thing,” he said. </p>

        <p>One of the compliments that Scott said made him bittersweet was when customers told him, “we don’t tell people about this place because we don’t want it to get busy.” They called it Gainesville’s “best-kept secret.” </p>

        <p>It was no secret that it was an up-and-coming venue with increasing sales, but it was not enough to keep the owners from selling it, he said. </p>

        <p>While ooZoo Bar and Dough Religion Pizza are down the street and tucked away from the Midtown scene, the location and older crowd was a selling point for some regulars. </p>


        <p>A group of four friends vowed to come to ooZoo Bar for all of its remaining days. </p>

        <p>For almost five years, Christine Voigt, a 33-year-old lecturer at UF, and her husband Thomas Hamm, a 29-year-old Target worker, searched for their place in Gainesville, a place where they would feel at home. When they found ooZoo Bar, they knew
          that was it. </p>

        <p>“I don’t know where I’m going to go anymore,” she said. “We don’t go out [to] other places.” </p>

        <p>Voigt used to bring a class of about 30 international students from the English Language Institute to Dough Religion Pizza. Although there was a lunch rush and a language barrier, the manager would be friendly and patient with them, taking his
          time, she said. </p>

        <p>Going to the bar two to three times a week was a tradition for Tomtine, the couple nickname the bartenders bestowed upon the regulars. </p>

        <p>“There’s a serious void that we can’t fill,” Hamm said. “This was the first place we’ve felt like we’ve belonged in five and a half years.” </p>

        <p>For Sean McCarty, a 30-year-old kitchen manager and assistant manager of the restaurants, his home was taken from him without a second thought. If put in the owner’s position, McCarty said he believes it would have been a lot harder for him to
          sell the place that gave him a second family. </p>

        <p>McCarty understands the decision from a business perspective, but said he thinks the owner did not understand the collateral damage he would be causing with human emotion. </p>

        <p>“It sucks for people who let go of their second job,” McCarty said. “Those are the things that I don’t think the owner necessarily realized.”

          <p>While he has left other restaurant jobs before, moving on has never been this difficult. </p>

          <p>“This one probably has more of ‘me’ in it,” he said, citing menu development, management procedures and vendor meetings, all of which he had a hand in. </p>

          <p>“It just hurts as a human who’s put so much into something to just have it torn away from you,” he said. </p>

          <p>McCarty has been telling customers who come into the restaurant that they are probably eating their last pizza from Dough Religion—a conversation he’d rather have in person rather than online, in order to see their reaction. </p>

          <p>There hasn’t been much time to publicize the closing, as the employees found out their fate on Friday, McCarty said. With limited supplies, the kitchen manager said he would rather the dwindling supplies “not be the last taste people get in
            their mouth.” </p>

          <p>“I’d rather us be remembered as a thriving local company,” he said. </p>
